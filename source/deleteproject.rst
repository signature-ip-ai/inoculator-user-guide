**Notes:**

  - Before deleting a project, ensure that any important data is backed up or shared. This is critical if the project contains valuable information that may be needed in the future.

  - Verify that you have selected the correct project, as deletion is irreversible.

  - Communicate with your team prior to deletion, especially if others rely on the project for their work.
