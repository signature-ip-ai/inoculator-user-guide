Notes:
  -	Before deleting a project, ensure that any important data are backed up or shared. This is crucial if the project contains valuable information that might be needed later. 
  -	Ensure that you are selecting the correct project, as deletion is irreversible. 
  -	Communicate with your team before deletion, especially if they rely on the project.
