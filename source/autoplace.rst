Auto Place
==================================

The Auto-Place determines the best positions for logic gates, memory blocks, and other circuit components. It aims to minimize wire length, reduce signal delay, and optimize overall performance. 

The tool strives to use the chip area efficiently by minimizing the space occupied by the placed components, leading to a more compact and cost-effective design.
