Invite User
===================================
This function is for Admin accounts. Once access is requested, all Inoculator admins will be notified, and the next step is to send an invitation to the requester to activate their account. This process is discussed in the 'Admin User Guide.' 

After verifying the requester's eligibility, an admin will send an invitation email. The requester will receive the following email content:

The invitation includes links to the Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Software Evaluation Agreement for the requester to access and review. It also contains a link for account activation.
