Access Map 
=================================
This feature allows users to view the policy of each device connected to each port. Currently, it includes only one category: Security Policy. In this matrix, users can view the policy assigned to each device (Initiator, Target and Virtual Target devices). Users can also configure each policy, and the changes will be reflected on the device. 
To view this, navigate to “Access Map” tab. 

  1. Security Policy

In this feature, the policy for each device is defined. The Security Device is not displayed on this matrix. Users can choose from four policies: Passthrough, Fixed Secure, Programmable, and Blocked. Greyed-out cell means the equivalent device is not reachable.
